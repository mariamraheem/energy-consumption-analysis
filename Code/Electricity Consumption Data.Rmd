## Purpose

Comparative analysis of residential electricity consumption patterns in California and Texas using EIA data and synthetic data for demonstration.

## Data Sources

### Original Data Source

This analysis originally relied on data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), accessed through the `eia` R package. The EIA provides comprehensive energy data, including electricity retail sales, revenue, and pricing information.

Key data points include:
- Revenue from sales
- Sales (Megawatt-hours sold to ultimate customers)
- Average price of electricity to ultimate customers
- Number of ultimate customers (consumption)

To use the actual EIA data, you would need to:
1. Obtain an API key from the EIA website
2. Set the API key in your environment: `Sys.setenv(EIA_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here")`
3. Use the `eia_data()` function to fetch real data

Note: For this demonstration, we use synthetic data to ensure reproducibility without requiring an API key.

### Synthetic Data for Demonstration

For the purpose of this demonstration and to ensure reproducibility without access to the EIA API, we generate synthetic data that mimics the structure and characteristics of the original EIA data.

## Methodology

- Data retrieval using the `eia` R package (for original analysis)
- Data generation using synthetic random distributions (for demonstration)
- State-level comparison of electricity metrics

## Dependencies

```
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(eia)
library(lubridate)
```

## Research Questions

1. How do electricity consumption patterns differ between CA and TX?
2. What are the variations in electricity pricing and revenue?

## Data Generation and Analysis

```
# Set your EIA API key using an environment variable
eia_set_key(Sys.getenv("EIA_API_KEY"))

# Function to generate synthetic data for demonstration
generate_synthetic_data <- function(start_date, end_date) {
  dates <- seq(as.Date(start_date), as.Date(end_date), by = "month")
  tibble(
    period = dates,
    revenue = runif(length(dates), 1000000, 5000000),
    sales = runif(length(dates), 1000000, 5000000),
    price = runif(length(dates), 0.05, 0.20),
    customers = runif(length(dates), 1000000, 5000000)
  )
}

# Function to get data for a specific state (using synthetic data for demonstration)
get_state_data <- function(state, start_date = "2010-01-01", end_date = "2024-12-31") {
  # For demonstration, we'll use synthetic data
  # In a real scenario, you would use the eia_data function here
  synthetic_data <- generate_synthetic_data(start_date, end_date)
  
  return(synthetic_data)
}

# Get data for California and Texas
ca_data <- get_state_data("CA")
tx_data <- get_state_data("TX")

# Combine data for both states
combined_data <- bind_rows(
  mutate(ca_data, state = "CA"),
  mutate(tx_data, state = "TX")
)

# Display the first few rows of the combined data
head(combined_data)
```

## Data Export

```
# Save the data to a configurable output directory
output_dir <- Sys.getenv("OUTPUT_DIR", ".")
write_csv(combined_data, file.path(output_dir, "electricity_syn_data_CA_TX_monthly.csv"))
```
